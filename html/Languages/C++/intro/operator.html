            <p>If a program is to be able to process the data input it receives, you must define the operations to be performed for that data. The operations being executed will depend on the
                type of data — you could add, multiply, or compare numbers, for example. However, it
                would make no sense at all to multiply strings.<br>
                The following sections introduce you to the most important operators that can be
                used for arithmetic types. A distinction is made between unary and binary operators. A
                unary operator has only one operand, whereas a binary operator has two.</p>

            <p><i>Arithmetic operators</i> are used to perform calculations. The opposite page shows an
                overview. You should be aware of the following:</p>

        <div class="unl">
            <ul>
                <li><i>Divisions</i> performed with integral operands will produce integral results; for example, 7/2 computes to 3. If at least one of the operands is a floating-point number,
                    the result will also be a floating-point number; e.g., the division 7.0/2 produces
                    an exact result of 3.5.</li>
                <li><i>Remainder division</i> is only applicable to integral operands and returns the remainder of an integral division. For example, 7%2 computes to 1.</li>

            <p>In its simplest form an expression consists of only one constant, one variable, or one
                function call. Expressions can be used as the operands of operators to form more complex
                expressions. An expression will generally tend to be a combination of operators and
                operands.
            <pre><b>Example</b>

            <p>A <i>simple</i> assignment uses the assignment operator = to assign the value of a variable to an

            <p>The operands for boolean type operators are of the bool type. However, operands of any
                type that can be converted to bool can also be used, including any arithmetic types. In
                this case the operand is interpreted as false, or converted to false, if it has a value of
                0. Any other value than 0 is interpreted as true.<br>
                The <b>OR</b> operator <b>||</b> will return true only if at least one operand is true, so the value
                of the expression
            <pre><b>Example</b>
        (length < 0.2) || (length > 9.8)</pre>
        is true if length is less than 0.2 or greater than 9.8.<br>
        The <b>AND</b> operator <b>&&</b> will return true only if both operands are true, so the logical
        expression
        <pre><b>Example</b>
        (index < max) && (cin >> number)</pre>is true, provided index is less than max and a number is successfully input. If the condition index < max is not met, the program will not attempt to read a number! One
        important feature of the logical operators && and || is the fact that there is a fixed order
        of evaluation. </p>
