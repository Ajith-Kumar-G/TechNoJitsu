            The C++ language is an object-oriented programming language & is a
            combination of both low-level & high-level language – a Middle-Level
            Language. The programming language was created, designed & developed
            by a Danish Computer Scientist – Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Telephone
            Laboratories (now known as Nokia Bell Labs) in Murray Hill, New
            Jersey. As he wanted a flexible & a dynamic language which was
            similar to C with all its features, but with additionality of active
            type checking, basic inheritance, default functioning argument,
            classes, inlining, etc. and hence C with Classes (C++) was launched.

            <li>
              The trace of the programming language C++ can be done back to 1979
              when<b> Bjarne Stroustrup</b> was doing some development for this
              thesis for PhD. One in all the words Stroustrup had the chance to
              figure with, was a language referred to as <b>Simula</b>, that
              because the name implies, could be a language primarily designed
              for simulations. The Simula sixty-seven language – that was the
              variant that Stroustrup worked with is considered the primary
              language to support the object-oriented programming paradigm.
              Stroustrup found that this paradigm was helpful for package
              development; but, the Simula language was way too slow for
              practice & practical use.
            </li>
            <li>
              Shortly subsequently, he began work on “<b>C with Classes</b>“,
              because what the name implies was meant to be a superset of the C
              language. His main dream was to get his advanced object-oriented
              programming, created by him, into the C language, which was during
              his era was still the programming language that was widely
              respected for its movability, portability & compactness, by not
              sacrificing the speed or the low-level practicality. His
              programming-language enclosed inlining, basic inheritance, default
              function arguments, categories, and reliable sort was checking
              additionally to all or any the options of the C language.
            </li>
            <li>
              The first C with categories compiler was referred to as
              <b>Cfront</b>, that got derived from a C compiler referred to as<b>
                CPre</b
              >. It had been a program designed to translate C with categories
              code to universal C. A rather attention-grabbing purpose value
              noting is that Cfront was written mostly in C with classes,
              creating it a self-hosting compiler (a compiler which will compile
              itself). Cfront would later be abandoned in 1993 when it became
              troublesome to integrate new options into it, mainly C++
              exceptions. Even so, Cfront created a significant impact on the
              implementations of future compilers and also the operating system
              UNIX.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 1983, the name of the language got modified from C with
              categories to C++. The ++ operator within the C language is the
              associate operator for incrementing a variable, which provides
              some insight into however Stroustrup regarded the programing
              language. Several new options got additional around this point,
              the foremost notable of that area unit virtual functions, perform
              overloading, references with the const keyword, and single-line
              comments by using the two forward slashes (which may be a feature
              taken from the language<b> BCPL</b>).
            </li>
            <li>
              In 1985, Stroustrup’s relation to the language entitled The
              <b>C++ programing language</b> was printed and got released. That
              very same year, C++ got enforced as an advertisement product and
              hence starting of it as a commercial element. The programing
              language wasn’t formally standardized, nevertheless creating the
              book an essential reference. The programing language was updated
              once more in 1989 to incorporate protected and static members,
              still as an associate inheritance from many categories & classes.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 1990, <b>The Annotated C++ manual</b>, which was a reference
              got released all over. In 1990 only, in the same & identical year,
              Borland’s <b>Turbo C++ compiler</b> would also be commercially
              discharged as an advertisement product. Turbo C++ additional an
              excessiveness of other libraries which might have a substantial
              impact on C++’s development. Though Turbo C++’s last stable
              unharness was in 2006, the compiler continues to get widely used.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 1998, the C++ customary advisory & standards committee printed
              the first international standard for
              <b>C++ ISO/IEC 14882:1998</b>, which might be informally called
              C++98. The Annotated C++ manual was aforementioned to be a
              significant influence within the development of the quality. The
              quality template library (also known as the Standard Template
              Library) that began its intellectual construction in 1979 got
              additionally enclosed in it. In 2003, the committee well-versed
              multiple issues that were according with their 1998 customary and
              revised it consequently. The modified language got dubbed as
              <b>C++03</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 2005, the same committee of C++ discharged a technical report
              (called as <b>TR1</b>) particularization varied options they were
              aiming to boost the newest C++ standard. The new rule was
              informally dubbed <b>C++0x</b> because it was expected to be
              discharged someday before the tip of the first decade. Ironically,
              however, the new customary wasn’t fulfilled until mid-2011. Many
              technical reports were discharged up till then, and a few
              compilers began adding experimental support for the new options
              and features.
            </li>
            <li>
              In mid-2011, the new C++ customary (dubbed <b>C++11</b>) got
              finished. The Boost library project created a substantial impact
              on the new rule, and a few of the new modules were derived
              directly from the corresponding Boost libraries. A number of the
              new options that got included were:

          <p>C++ is an upgraded version of C programming. The main idea behind creating C++ programming was to add object orientation to the 
              C programming language. The major upgradations are object-oriented programming methodology, namespace feature, operator overloading, 
              error & exception handling. The motivation behind object-oriented programming is to try to see the whole world in the form of classes

             </ul>
             Let’s discuss each one of them one by one.
              </p>
             
          <h3 id="OOP" class="hd3">Object Oriented Programming language</h3>
          <p>The main upgradation from C to C++ is object-oriented programming. It follows concept of oops like polymorphism, inheritance, 
              encapsulation, abstraction. This makes development and maintenance easier. 
          </p>
          Let’s briefly understand the concepts of object-oriented programming.
          <dl>
          <dt>Class:</dt> 
          <dd>A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.
          </dd>
          <dt>Object:</dt> 
          <dd>It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents the real-life entities. A C++ program creates many objects which interact by invoking methods.
          </dd>
          <dt>Polymorphism:</dt> 
          <dd>Polymorphism refers to the ability of OOPs programming languages to differentiate between entities with the same name efficiently.
          </dd>
          <dt>Inheritance:</dt> 
          <dd>Inheritance is the mechanism in which one class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class.
          </dd>
          <dt>Encapsulation:</dt> 
          <dd>Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates.
          </dd>
          <dt>Abstraction:</dt> 
          <dd>Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user. The trivial or the non-essentials units are not displayed to the user.
          </dd>
          </dl>
          
          <h3 class="hd3">Simple</h3>
          <p>C++ provides a structured approach wherein you can break the problem into parts and design the solution modularly. It provides you a rich set of library functions that you can use while implementing the solution.
              If you have worked with C language, then moving to C++ would be a very smooth transitioning. The syntax is almost similar with minute changes. 
              </p>
          
          <h3 class="hd3">Platform Dependent</h3>
          <p>Platform dependent language means the language in which programs can be executed only on that operating system where it is developed & compiled. It cannot run or execute it on any other operating system. 
          </p>
          <p>C++ is a platform-dependent language. Having said that, C++ programs can be executed in many machines with little bit or no change.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="hd3">Mid-level programming language</h3>
          <p>C++ has the ability to do both low-level & high-level programming. This is the reason why C++ is known as a mid-level programming 
              language. When we talk about low-level programming, C++ is used to develop system applications such as the kernel, driver, etc. 
              </p>
          
          <h3 class="hd3">Structured programming language</h3>
          <p>In C++ programming, the code is modular with the help of functions, classes & objects, and the modules are loosely coupled. 
              Modular code is easy to understand & modify. This makes C++ a structured programming language. 
              </p>
          <h3 class="hd3">Rich Library</h3>
          <p>Developers have access to lots of in-built functions provided by C++ language. This saves time & makes development fast. 
              Let’s look at some of the C++ header files & functionalities provided by it.
              </p>
          <ul>
          <li>&lt;iostream&gt; : Contains C++ standard input and output functions</li>
          <li>&lt;iomanip&gt;  : Contains stream manipulators that format streams of data</li>
          <li>&lt;cmath&gt;    : Contains math library functions</li>
          <li>&lt;cstdlib&gt;  : Contains function for conversions of numbers to text and vise versa, memory allocation, random numbers
               and various other utility functions. </li>
          <li>&lt;ctime&gt;    : Contains function for manipulating the time and date</li>
          <li>&lt;fstream&gt;  : Contains function for functions that perform input from files on disk and output to files on disk</li>
          <li>&lt;memory&gt;   : Contains classes and functions used by the C++ Standard Library to allocate memory to the C++ Standard 
              Library containers</li>
          <li>&lt;iterator&gt; : Contains classes for accessing data in the C++ Standard Library containers</li>
          <li>&lt;algorithm&gt;: Contains functions for manipulating data in C++ Standard Library containers</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="hd3">Memory Management</h3>
          C++ supports dynamic memory allocation. You can free the allocated memory at any time. Not only this C++ also provides dynamic memory 
          management techniques. 
          
          
          <h3 class="hd3">Powerful & Fast</h3>
          C++ is a fast language as compilation and execution time is less. Also, it has a wide variety of data types, functions & operators.
          
          <h3 class="hd3">Pointers</h3>
          Pointers are variables that store the address of another variable. Pointer points to the memory location of a variable. C++ supports pointer and provides solutions to lots of problems that demand access to memory location.
          
          <h3 class="hd3">Compiler based</h3>
          C++ is a compiler-based programming language.  Without compilation, no C++ program can be executed. The compiler first compiles the C++ program and then it is executed.
          
          <h3 class="hd3">Syntax based language</h3>
          
          <p>C++ is a language that complies strongly with syntax. Language following rules and regulations very strictly is known as tight 
              syntax-based language. C, C++, Java, .net are some of the examples. 
          </p>
          <p>Now I hope you would have understood different features provided by C++. I hope this blog is informative and added value to you.
