  <h2 id="historyc++" class="hd2">History</h2>
<div class="cont">
<p>The C++ programming language has a history going back to 1979, when Bjarne Stroustrup was doing work for his Ph.D. thesis. 
  One of the languages Stroustrup had the opportunity to work with was a language called Simula, which as the name implies is a 
  language primarily designed for simulations. The Simula 67 language - which was the variant that Stroustrup worked with - is 
  regarded as the first language to support the object-oriented programming paradigm. Stroustrup found that this paradigm was very 
  useful for software development, however the Simula language was far too slow for practical use.
</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, he began work on "C with Classes", which as the name implies was meant to be a superset of the C language.
    His goal was to add object-oriented programming into the C language, which was and still is a language well-respected for its 
    portability without sacrificing speed or low-level functionality. His language included classes, basic inheritance, inlining, 
    default function arguments, and strong type checking in addition to all the features of the C language.
   </p>
<p>The first C with Classes compiler was called Cfront, which was derived from a C compiler called CPre. It was a program designed 
    to translate C with Classes code to ordinary C. A rather interesting point worth noting is that Cfront was written mostly in 
    C with Classes, making it a self-hosting compiler (a compiler that can compile itself). Cfront would later be abandoned in 1993 
    after it became difficult to integrate new features into it, namely C++ exceptions. Nonetheless, Cfront made a huge impact on the
     implementations of future compilers and on the Unix operating system.
    </p>
<p>In 1983, the name of the language was changed from C with Classes to C++. The ++ operator in the C language is an operator for 
    incrementing a variable, which gives some insight into how Stroustrup regarded the language. Many new features were added around
     this time, the most notable of which are virtual functions, function overloading, references with the & symbol, the const keyword, 
     and single-line comments using two forward slashes (which is a feature taken from the language BCPL).
    </p>
</div>
<h2 id="featuresc++" class="hd2">Features of C++</h2>

<p>C++ is an upgraded version of C programming. The main idea behind creating C++ programming was to add object orientation to the 
    C programming language. The major upgradations are object-oriented programming methodology, namespace feature, operator overloading, 
    error & exception handling. The motivation behind object-oriented programming is to try to see the whole world in the form of classes
    & objects.</p> 

<p>There are various features of C++ such as,
   <ul>
    <li>Object Oriented</li>
    <li>Simple</li>
    <li>Platform Dependent</li>
    <li>Mid-level programming language</li>
    <li>Structured programming language</li>
    <li>Rich Library</li>
    <li>Memory Management</li>
    <li>Powerful & Fast </li>
    <li>Pointers</li>
    <li>basedCompiler</li>
    <li>Syntax based language</li>
   </ul>
   Let’s discuss each one of them one by one.
    </p>
   
<h3 id="OOP" class="hd3">Object Oriented Programming language</h3>
<p>The main upgradation from C to C++ is object-oriented programming. It follows concept of oops like polymorphism, inheritance, 
    encapsulation, abstraction. This makes development and maintenance easier. 
</p>
Let’s briefly understand the concepts of object-oriented programming.
<dl>
<dt>Class:</dt> 
<dd>A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.
</dd>
<dt>Object:</dt> 
<dd>It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents the real-life entities. A C++ program creates many objects which interact by invoking methods.
</dd>
<dt>Polymorphism:</dt> 
<dd>Polymorphism refers to the ability of OOPs programming languages to differentiate between entities with the same name efficiently.
</dd>
<dt>Inheritance:</dt> 
<dd>Inheritance is the mechanism in which one class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class.
</dd>
<dt>Encapsulation:</dt> 
<dd>Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates.
</dd>
<dt>Abstraction:</dt> 
<dd>Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user. The trivial or the non-essentials units are not displayed to the user.
</dd>
</dl>

<h3 class="hd3">Simple</h3>
<p>C++ provides a structured approach wherein you can break the problem into parts and design the solution modularly. It provides you a rich set of library functions that you can use while implementing the solution.
    If you have worked with C language, then moving to C++ would be a very smooth transitioning. The syntax is almost similar with minute changes. 
    </p>

<h3 class="hd3">Platform Dependent</h3>
<p>Platform dependent language means the language in which programs can be executed only on that operating system where it is developed & compiled. It cannot run or execute it on any other operating system. 
</p>
<p>C++ is a platform-dependent language. Having said that, C++ programs can be executed in many machines with little bit or no change.
</p>

<h3 class="hd3">Mid-level programming language</h3>
<p>C++ has the ability to do both low-level & high-level programming. This is the reason why C++ is known as a mid-level programming 
    language. When we talk about low-level programming, C++ is used to develop system applications such as the kernel, driver, etc. 
    </p>

<h3 class="hd3">Structured programming language</h3>
<p>In C++ programming, the code is modular with the help of functions, classes & objects, and the modules are loosely coupled. 
    Modular code is easy to understand & modify. This makes C++ a structured programming language. 
    </p>
<h3 class="hd3">Rich Library</h3>
<p>Developers have access to lots of in-built functions provided by C++ language. This saves time & makes development fast. 
    Let’s look at some of the C++ header files & functionalities provided by it.
    </p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;iostream&gt; : Contains C++ standard input and output functions</li>
<li>&lt;iomanip&gt;  : Contains stream manipulators that format streams of data</li>
<li>&lt;cmath&gt;    : Contains math library functions</li>
<li>&lt;cstdlib&gt;  : Contains function for conversions of numbers to text and vise versa, memory allocation, random numbers
     and various other utility functions. </li>
<li>&lt;ctime&gt;    : Contains function for manipulating the time and date</li>
<li>&lt;fstream&gt;  : Contains function for functions that perform input from files on disk and output to files on disk</li>
<li>&lt;memory&gt;   : Contains classes and functions used by the C++ Standard Library to allocate memory to the C++ Standard 
    Library containers</li>
<li>&lt;iterator&gt; : Contains classes for accessing data in the C++ Standard Library containers</li>
<li>&lt;algorithm&gt;: Contains functions for manipulating data in C++ Standard Library containers</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="hd3">Memory Management</h3>
C++ supports dynamic memory allocation. You can free the allocated memory at any time. Not only this C++ also provides dynamic memory 
management techniques. 


<h3 class="hd3">Powerful & Fast</h3>
C++ is a fast language as compilation and execution time is less. Also, it has a wide variety of data types, functions & operators.

<h3 class="hd3">Pointers</h3>
Pointers are variables that store the address of another variable. Pointer points to the memory location of a variable. C++ supports pointer and provides solutions to lots of problems that demand access to memory location.

<h3 class="hd3">Compiler based</h3>
C++ is a compiler-based programming language.  Without compilation, no C++ program can be executed. The compiler first compiles the C++ program and then it is executed.

<h3 class="hd3">Syntax based language</h3>

<p>C++ is a language that complies strongly with syntax. Language following rules and regulations very strictly is known as tight 
    syntax-based language. C, C++, Java, .net are some of the examples. 
</p>
