        <div class="intro"><p>A program can use several data to solve a given problem, for example, characters, integers, or floating-point numbers. Since a computer uses different methods for processing
            and saving data, the data type must be known. The type defines</p></div>
        <div class="unl">
            <ul>
                <li>the internal representation of the data, </li>
                <li>the amount of memory to allocate.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3 id="bool">The Type bool</h3>  
        <div class="cont">
            <p>The result of a comparison or a logical association using AND or OR is a boolean value,
                which can be true or false. C++ uses the bool type to represent boolean values. An
                expression of the type bool can either be true or false, where the internal value for
                true will be represented as the numerical value 1 and false by a zero.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="char">Char type</h3> 
        <div class="cont">
            <p>These types are used for saving character codes. A character code is an integer associated
                with each character. The letter A is represented by code 65, for example. The character
                set defines which code represents a certain character. When displaying characters on
                screen, the applicable character codes are transmitted and the “receiver,” that is the
                screen, is responsible for correctly interpreting the codes.<br>The <i>char</i>(character) type is used to store character codes in one byte (8 bits). This
                amount of storage is sufficient for extended character sets, for example, the ANSI character set that contains the ASCII codes and additional characters such as German
                umlauts.<br>The <i>wchar_t</i> (wide character type) type comprises at least 2 bytes (16 bits) and is
                thus capable of storing modern Unicode characters.<i>Unicode</i> is a 16-bit code also used in
                Windows NT and containing codes for approximately 35,000 characters in 24 languages.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="int">Integral types</h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>The types <i>short, int,</i> and<i> long</i> are available for operations with integers. These types
                are distinguished by their ranges of values. The table on the opposite page shows the
                integer types, which are also referred to as integral types, with their typical storage
                requirements and ranges of values.<br>The int (integer) type is tailor-made for computers and adapts to the length of a register on the computer. For 16-bit computers, <i>int</i> is thus equivalent to <i>short</i>, whereas
                for 32-bit computers <i>int</i> will be equivalent to <i>long</i>.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="float">Floating-point types</h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>Numbers with a fraction part are indicated by a decimal point in C++ and are referred to
                as floating-point numbers. In contrast to integers, floating-point numbers must be stored
                to a preset accuracy. The following three types are available for calculations involving
                floating-point numbers:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tbl">
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td><pre>float</pre></td><td> for simple accuracy</td> 
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><pre>double</pre></td><td> for double accuracy</td> 
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><pre>long double</pre></td><td>for high accuracy</td> 
                </tr>
            </table> 
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>The value range and accuracy of a type are derived from the amount of memory allocated
                and the internal representation of the type.<br><i>Accuracy</i> is expressed in decimal places. This means that “six decimal places” allows a
                programmer to store two floating-point numbers that differ within the first six decimal
                places as separate numbers.<br><br>The fundamental types in C++ are integer types, floating-point types, and the void type.
                The types used for integers and floating-point numbers are collectively referred to as
                arithmetic types, as arithmetic operators are defined for them.<br>
                The void type is used for expressions that do not represent a value. A function call
                can thus take a void type.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 id="constant">CONSTANTS</h2>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>The boolean keywords true and false, a number, a character, or a character sequence
                (string) are all constants, which are also referred to as a literals. Constants can thus be
                subdivided into</p>
        </div>
        <div class="unl">
            <ul>
                <li>boolean constants</li>
                <li>numerical constants</li>
                <li>character constants</li>

            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3 id="Boolean Constants">Boolean Constants</h3>
        <div class="cont"><p>A boolean expression can have two values that are identified by the keywords true and
            false. Both constants are of the bool type. They can be used, for example, to set flags
            representing just two states.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="Integral Constants">Integral Constants</h3>
        <div class="cont"> 
        <p>Integral numerical constants can be represented as simple decimal numbers, octals, or
            hexadecimals<br>Integral constants are normally of type int. If the value of the constant is too large
            for the int type, a type capable of representing larger values will be applied. The ranking
            for decimal constants is as follows:
            <pre><b>Example</b>
        int, long, unsigned long </pre>You can designate the type of a constant by adding the letter L or l (for long), or U
            or u (for unsigned).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="orl">
            <ol>
                <li><b>12L</b> and <b>12l</b> correspond to the type long</li>
                <li><b>12U</b> and <b>12u</b> correspond to the type unsigned int</li>
                <li><b>12UL</b> and <b>12ul</b> correspond to the type unsigned long</li>
            </ol>
            
        </div>
        <div class="unl">
            <ul>
                <li>a <i>decimal constant</i> (base 10) begins with a decimal number other than zero, such as 109 or 987650</li>
                <li>an <i>octal constant</i> (base 8) begins with a leading 0, for example 077 or 01234567</li>
                <li>a <i>hexadecimal constant</i> (base 16) begins with the character pair 0x or 0X, for example 0x2A0 or 0X4b1C. Hexadecimal numbers can be capitalized or noncapitalized</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3 id="Floating-Point Constants">Floating-Point Constants</h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>Floating-point numbers are always represented as decimals, a decimal point being used to
                distinguish the fraction part from the integer part. However, exponential notation is also
                permissible.<br>
            <pre><b>Example</b>
        27.1 1.8E–2          // <i>Type:double</i></pre> </p>    
        </div>
        <h3 id="Character Constants">Character Constants</h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>A character constant is a character enclosed in single quotes. Character constants take
                the type char:<br>
            <pre><b>Example</b>
        'A'  // <i>Type:char</i></pre> The numerical value is the character code representing the character. The constant 'A'
                thus has a value of 65 in ASCII code. </p>    
        </div>
        <h3 id="String Constants">String Constants</h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>A string constant is stored internally without the quotes but terminated with a<i> null character</i>, \0, represented by a byte with a numerical value of 0 — that is, all the bits in this
                byte are set to 0. Thus, a string occupies one byte more in memory than the number of
                characters it contains. An empty string, "", therefore occupies a single byte.<br>
            <pre><b>Example</b>
        "Today is a beautiful day!"</pre></p>    
        </div>
        <h2 id="valid names">Valid Names</h2>
        <div class="unl">
            <ul>
                <li>a name contains a series of letters, numbers, or underscore characters ( _ ). German umlauts and accented letters are invalid. C++ is case sensitive; that is,
                    upper- and lowercase letters are different.</li>
                <lI>the first character must be a letter or underscore</lI>
                <li>there are no restrictions on the length of a name and all the characters in the
                    name are significant</li>
                <li>C++ keywords are reserved and cannot be used as names.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2 id="variables">variables</h2>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>Data such as numbers, characters, or even complete records are stored in variables to
                enable their processing by a program. Variables are also referred to as objects, particularly
                if they belong to a class.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="define">Definig Variable</h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>A variable must be defined before you can use it in a program. When you define a variable the type is specified and an appropriate amount of memory reserved. This memory
                space is addressed by reference to the name of the variable. A simple definition has the following syntax:
            <pre><b>SYNTAX:</b> typ name1 [name2 ... ];</pre> <br>
        <pre><b>Example</b>
        char c;
        int i, counter;
        double x, y, size;</pre> </p> 
        </div>
        <h3 id="Initialization">Initialization</h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>A variable can be initialized, i.e. a value can be assigned to the variable, during its definition. Initialization is achieved by placing the following immediately after the name of
                the variable:<br>an equals sign ( = ) and an initial value for the variable or
                 round brackets containing the value of the variable.<br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <pre>
