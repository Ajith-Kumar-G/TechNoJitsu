        <h3 id="Reference">Reference operator (&) </h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>As soon as we declare a variable, the amount of memory needed is assigned for it at a specific location in memory
                (its memory address). We generally do not actively decide the exact location of the variable within the panel of
                cells that we have imagined the memory to be - Fortunately, that is a task automatically performed by the
                operating system during runtime. However, in some cases we may be interested in knowing the address where our
                variable is being stored during runtime in order to operate with relative positions to it.<br>
                The address that locates a variable within memory is what we call a reference to that variable. This reference to a
                variable can be obtained by preceding the identifier of a variable with an ampersand sign (&), known as reference
                operator, and which can be literally translated as "address of". For example: 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>ted = &amp;andy;
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>This would assign to ted the address of variable andy, since when preceding the name of the variable andy with
                the reference operator (&amp;) we are no longer talking about the content of the variable itself, but about its reference
                (i.e., its address in memory).
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="Dereference">Dereference operator (&ast;) </h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>r. Pointers are said
                to "point to" the variable whose reference they store.<br>
                Using a pointer we can directly access the value stored in the variable which it points to. To do this, we simply
                have to precede the pointer's identifier with an asterisk (&ast;), which acts as dereference operator and that can be
                literally translated to "value pointed by".<br>Therefore, following with the values of the previous example, if we write:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>beth = &ast;ted;
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>Notice the difference between the reference and dereference operators:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="unl">
            <ul>
                <li>&amp; is the reference operator and can be read as "address of" </li>
                <li>&ast;* is the dereference operator and can be read as "value pointed by"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3 id="declaring">Declaring variables of pointer types </h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>Due to the ability of a pointer to directly refer to the value that it points to, it becomes necessary to specify in its
                declaration which data type a pointer is going to point to. It is not the same thing to point to a char as to point to
                an int or a float.<br>
                The declaration of pointers follows this format:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>type &ast; name;
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>where type is the data type of the value that the pointer is intended to point to. This type is not the type of the
                pointer itself! but the type of the data the pointer points to.<br>Now have a look at this code: 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
<pre><i>// my first pointer</i>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
int main ()
{
    int firstvalue, secondvalue;
    int * mypointer;
    mypointer = &firstvalue;
    &ast;mypointer = 10;
    mypointer = &secondvalue;
    &ast;mypointer = 20;
    cout << "firstvalue is " << firstvalue << endl;
    cout << "secondvalue is " << secondvalue << endl;
    return 0;
}</pre></td> <td><pre>firstvalue is 10
secondvalue is 20</pre></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>Notice that even though we have never directly set a value to either <i>firstvalue</i> or <i>secondvalue</i>, both end up with
                a value set indirectly through the use of <i>mypointer</i>. This is the procedure:<br>
                First, we have assigned as value of <i>mypointer</i> a reference to <i>firstvalue</i> using the reference operator (&). And
                then we have assigned the value 10 to the memory location pointed by <i>mypointer</i>, that because at this moment is
                pointing to the memory location of <i>firstvalue</i>, this in fact modifies the value of <i>firstvalue</i>.<br>
                In order to demonstrate that a pointer may take several different values during the same program I have repeated
                the process with <i>secondvalue</i> and that same pointer, <i>mypointer</i>.<br>
                Here is an example a little bit more elaborated:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
           
<pre><i>// more pointers</i>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
int main ()
{
    int firstvalue = 5, secondvalue = 15;
    int &ast; p1, &ast; p2;
    p1 = &firstvalue; <i>// p1 = address of firstvalue</i>
    p2 = &secondvalue;<i> // p2 = address of secondvalue</i>
    &ast;p1 = 10; <i>// value pointed by p1 = 10</i>
    &ast;p2 = &ast;p1;<i> // value pointed by p2 = value pointed by</i>
p1
    p1 = p2; <i>// p1 = p2 (value of pointer is copied)</i>
    &ast;p1 = 20; <i>// value pointed by p1 = 20</i>
    cout << "firstvalue is " << firstvalue << endl;
    cout << "secondvalue is " << secondvalue << endl;
    return 0;
} 
        </pre></div>
<pre>firstvalue is 10
secondvalue is 20</pre>
        
        <h3 id="pointer">Pointers and arrays </h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>The concept of array is very much bound to the one of pointer. In fact, the identifier of an array is equivalent to the
                address of its first element, as a pointer is equivalent to the address of the first element that it points to, so in fact
                they are the same concept. For example, supposing these two declarations:                 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>int numbers [20];

        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>The following assignment operation would be valid:

        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>p = numbers;
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>After that, <em>p</em> and <em>numbers</em> would be equivalent and would have the same properties. The only difference is that we
                could change the value of pointer p by another one, whereas <em>numbers</em> will always point to the first of the 20
                elements of type int with which it was defined. Therefore, unlike <em>p</em>, which is an ordinary pointer, <em>numbers</em> is an
                array, and an array can be considered a constant pointer. Therefore, the following allocation would not be valid:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>numbers = p;
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>Because <em>numbers</em> is an array, so it operates as a constant pointer, and we cannot assign values to constants
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">

        <div class="cont">
            <p>When declaring pointers we may want to explicitly specify which variable we want them to point to:

            <pre>int number;

        <div class="cont">
            <p>The behavior of this code is equivalent to:

            <pre>int number;
int &ast;tommy;
tommy = &number;

        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>When a pointer initialization takes place we are always assigning the reference value to where the pointer points
                (tommy), never the value being pointed (&ast;tommy). You must consider that at the moment of declaring a pointer, the
                asterisk (&ast;) indicates only that it is a pointer, it is not the dereference operator (although both use the same sign:
                &ast;). Remember, they are two different functions of one sign. Thus, we must take care not to confuse the previous
                code with:
            </p>

        <h3 id="Pointers to pointers">Pointers to pointers </h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>C++ allows the use of pointers that point to pointers, that these, in its turn, point to data (or even to other
                pointers). In order to do that, we only need to add an asterisk (&ast;) for each level of reference in their declarations:

            <p>The void type of pointer is a special type of pointer. In C++, void represents the absence of type, so void pointers
                are pointers that point to a value that has no type (and thus also an undetermined length and undetermined
                dereference properties).<br>
                This allows void pointers to point to any data type, from an integer value or a float to a string of characters. But in
                exchange they have a great limitation: the data pointed by them cannot be directly dereferenced (which is logical,
                since we have no type to dereference to), and for that reason we will always have to cast the address in the void
                pointer to some other pointer type that points to a concrete data type before dereferencing it.<br>
