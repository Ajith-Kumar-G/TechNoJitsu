        <div class="intro">
            <p>When we consider a C++ program, it can be defined as a collection of objects that communicate via invoking each other's methods. Let us now briefly look into what a class,
                object, methods, and instant variables mean.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="unl">
            <ul>
            <li><b>Object</b>- Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name,
                breed as well as behaviors - wagging, barking, and eating. An object is an instance of
                a class.</li>
            <li><b>Class</b>- A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the
                behaviors/states that object of its type support.</li>
            <li><b>Methods</b>- A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is
                in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions are
                executed.</li> 
            <li><b>Instant Variables</b>- Each object has its unique set of instant variables. An object's
                state is created by the values assigned to these instant variables</li></ul>

            <h2 id="program">C++ Program Structure</h2>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>Let us look at a simple code that would print the words <i>Hello World.</i></p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>
#include < iostream.h >
using namespace std;
// main() is where program execution begins.
int main()
{   
    cont<< "Hello World"; // prints Hello World
    return 0;
}   
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>Let us look at the various parts of the above program:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="unl">
            <ul>
            <li>The C++ language defines several headers, which contain information that is either
                necessary or useful to your program. For this program, the header<b><iostream></b> is
                needed.</li>
            <li>The line <b>using neamespac std;</b> tells the compiler to use the std namespace.
                Namespaces are a relatively recent addition to C++.</li> 
            <li>. The next line ‘<b>// main() is where program execution begins.</b>’ is a single-line
                comment available in C++. Single-line comments begin with // and stop at the end of
                the line.</li>  
            <li>The line <b>int main()</b> is the main function where program execution begins.</li> 
            <li>The next line <b>cout << "This is my first C++ program.";</b> causes the message "This
                is my first C++ program" to be displayed on the screen.</li>
            <li>The next line <b>return 0;</b> terminates main() function and causes it to return the value 0
                to the calling process.</li>  </ul>  
        </div>
        <h2 id="compile">Compile & Execute C++ Program</h2>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>Let's look at how to save the file, compile and run the program. Please follow the steps given
                below:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="unl">
            <ul>
            <li>Open a text editor and add the code as above.</li>
            <li>Save the file as: hello.cpp</li>
            <li>Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you saved the file.</li>
            <li>Type 'g++ hello.cpp' and press enter to compile your code. If there are no errors in
                your code the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out
                executable file.</li>
            <li>Now, type 'a.out' to run your program.</li>
                <li>You will be able to see ' Hello World ' printed on the window</li></ul>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>
$ g++ hello.cpp
$ ./a.out
Hello World                
            </pre>
        </div>
        <h2 id="blocks">Semicolons & Blocks in C++</h2>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>In C++, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be
                ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.<br>For example, following are three different statements:
<pre>
x = y;
y = y+1;
add(x, y);    
</pre>A block is a set of logically connected statements that are surrounded by opening and closing
braces. For example:
<pre>
{
    cout << "Hello World"; // prints Hello World
    return 0;
}
</pre>C++ does not recognize the end of the line as a terminator. For this reason, it does not matter
where you put a statement in a line. For example:
<pre>
x = y;
y = y+1;
add(x, y);    
</pre>is the same as
<pre>
x = y; y = y+1; add(x, y);
</pre></p>
        </div>
        <h2 id="C++ Identifiers">C++ Identifiers</h2>
        <div class="cont">
         <p>A C++ identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or any other
            user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_)
            followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).</p>
            Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers:
<pre>
mohd      zara  abc move_name  a_123
myname50  _temp j   a23b9      retVal

        <h2 id="Whitespace in C++">Whitespace in C++</h2>
        <div class="cont">
         <p>A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and
            C++ compiler totally ignores it.<br>Whitespace is the term used in C++ to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and
            comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element
            begins. Statement 1:
<pre>
int age;
</pre>In the above statement there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space)
between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. Statement 2:
<pre>
fruit = apples + oranges; <i>// Get the total fruit</i>
</pre><br> In the above statement 2, no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or
between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish for readability
purpose.</p>   
        </div>
        <h2 id="comments">Comments In C++</h2>
        <div class="cont">
        <p>C++ supports single-line and multi-line comments. All characters available inside any
            comment are ignored by C++ compiler.<br>C++ comments start with /* and end with */. For example:
<pre>
/* This is a comment */
/* C++ comments can also
* span multiple lines
*/    
</pre>A comment can also start with //, extending to the end of the line. For example:
<pre>
#include < iostream.h >
using namespace std;
main()
{
    cout << "Hello World"; // prints Hello World
    return 0;
}
</pre>When the above code is compiled, it will ignore<b> // prints Hello World</b> and final executable
will produce the following result:
<pre>
Hello World
</pre>Within a /* and */ comment, // characters have no special meaning. Within a // comment, /*
and */ have no special meaning. Thus, you can "nest" one kind of comment within the other
kind. For example:
<pre>
/* Comment out printing of Hello World:
cout << "Hello World"; // prints Hello World
*/
</pre>      </p>
