          <h2 class="hd1" id="history">History of C</h2>
        <div class="cont">
          <p>
            C is a general-purpose programming language which features economny
            modern control flow and data structures, and a rich set of
            operators. C is not a <q>very high level</q> language, nor a
            <q>big</q> one, and is not of expression, specialized to any
            particular area of application. But its absence of restrictions and
            its generality make it more convenient and effective for many tasks
            than supposedly more powerful languages.<br />The history of C
            programming language is quite interesting. C was originally designed
            for and implemented on the<b> UNIX Operating system</b> on the DEC
            PDP-1, by <i>Dennis Ritchie</i>. C is the result of a development
            process that started with an older language called BCPL. BCPL was
            developed by<i> Martin Richards</i>, and it influenced a language
            called B, which was invented by<i> Ken Thompson</i>.B led to the
            development of C in the 1970s.<br />For many years, the de facto
            standard for C was the version supplied with the UNIX operating
            system. In the summer of 1983 a committee was established to create
            an<b> ANSI (American National Standards Institute)</b> standard that
            would define the c language. The standardization process took six
            years (much longer than anyone reasonably expected).<br />The ANSIC
            standard was finally adopted in December 1989, with the first copies
            becoming available in early 1990. The standard was also adopted by
            ISO (nternational Standards organization), and the resulting
            standard was typically referred to as ANSI/ISso Standard C. In 1995,
            Amendment 1 to the C standard was adopted, which, among other
            things, added several new library functions. The 1989 standard for
            C, along with Amendment 1, became a base document for Standard C++,
            defining the C<b> subset of C++</b>. The version of C defined by the
            1989 standard is commonly referred to as C89.<br />During the 1990s,
            a new standard for C was being developed. It was the 1999 standard
            for C, usually referred to as C99. In general, C99 retained nearly
            all of the features of C89. The C99 standardization committee
            focused on two main areas: the addition of several numeric libraries
            and the development of some special-use, but highly innovative, new
            features, such as variable-length arrays and the restrict pointer
            qualifier. These innovations have once again put C at the forefront
            of computer language development.<br />C89 is the version of C in
            widest use, it is currently accepted by all C compilers, and it
            forms the basis for C++.

        <div class="cont">
          <p>
            As we studied earlier, C is a base language for many programming
            languages. So, learning C as the main language will play an
            important role while studying other programming languages. It shares
            the same concepts such as data types, operators, control statements
            and many more. C can be used widely in various applications. It is a
            simple language and provides faster execution. There are many jobs
            available for a 'C' developer in the current market.<br />C is a
            structured programming language in which program is divided into
            various modules. Each module can be written separately and together
            it forms a single C program. This structure makes it easy for
            testing, maintaining and debugging processes.<br />C contains 32
            keywords, various data types and a set of powerful built-in
            functions that make programming very efficient.<br />Another feature
            of C programming is that it can extend itself. A C program contains
            various functions which are part of a library. We can add our
            features and functions to the library. We can access and use these
            functions anytime we want in our program. This feature makes it
            simple while working with complex programming.<br />Various
            compilers are available in the market that can be used for executing
            programs written in this language.<br /><i
              >It is a highly portable language which means programs written in
              'C' language can run on other machines</i
            >. This feature is essential if we wish to use or execute the code
            on another computer.

            In 1978,<i>Brian Kernighan</i> and <i>Dennis Ritchie</i> published
            the first edition of The C Programming Language. This book, known to
            C programmers as <q>K&R</q>, served for many years as an informal
            specification of the language. The version of C that it describes is
            commonly referred to as K&R C. The second edition of the book covers
            the later <b>ANSI</b> C standard, described below.

            In 1983, the American National Standards Institute formed a
            committee, X3Jll, to establish a standard specification of C. The
            standard was completed in 1989 and ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989
            "Programming Language C". This version of the language is often
            referred to as ANSI C. Later on sometimes the label C89 is used to
            distinguish it from C99 but using the same labelling method.

            The same standard as C89 was ratified by the International
            Organization for Standardization as ISO/IEC 9899:1990, with only
            formatting changes, which is sometimes referred to as C90. The terms
            C8191 and C90 refer to essentially the same language.

            In 1995, the ISO published an extension, called Amendment 1, for the
            ANSI-C standard. Its full name finally was ISO/IEC 9899/AMDI:1995 or
            nicknamed C95. Aside from error correction there were further
            changes to the language capabilities, Improved multi-byte and wide
            character support in the standard library,Several new core language
            features, including static array indices, designated initializers,
            compound literals, variable-length arrays, flexible array members,
            variadic macros,Removed several dangerous C89 language features such

         new library headers, including stdint.h, &lt;tgmath.h&gt;, fenv.h, &lt;complex.h&gt;
         Improved compatibility with several C++ features, including inline functions, single-line comments, mixing declarations and code, universal character names in identifiers
         Removed several dangerous C89 language features such as implicit function declarations and implicit int
