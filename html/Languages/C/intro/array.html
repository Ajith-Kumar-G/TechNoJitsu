    <h2 id="arrays">ARRAYS</h2>
<div class="cont">
   <p> Cprogramming language provides a data structure called the array, which can store
    a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a
    collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables
    of the same type.</p>
<p>Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99,
    you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ...,
    numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by
    an index.</p>
<p>All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the
    first element and the highest address to the last element.</p>
<h3 id="adeclaration">ARRAY DECLARATION</h3>
<p>To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number
    of elements required by an array as follows:</p>
<div class="code">type arrayName [ arraySize ];</div>
T<p>his is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant
    greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-
    element array called balance of type double, use this statement:</p>
<div class="code">double balance[10];</div>
Now balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up-to 10 double numbers.
</div>
<h3 id="ainitialising">Initializing Arrays</h3>
<div class="cont">
You can initialize array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows:
<div class="code">double balance[5] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 17.0, 50.0};</div>
The number of values between braces { } can not be larger than the number of elements
that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ](The number inside [] is also called index). Following is an example to
assign a single element of the array:<br>
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is
created. Therefore, if you write:
<div class="code">double balance[] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 17.0, 50.0};</div>
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example.
<div class="code">balance[4] = 50.0;</div>
</div>
<table>
    <tr><th>INDEX</th><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr>
    <tr><th>ELEMENT</th><td>1000.0</td><td>2.0</td><td>3.4</td><td>17.0</td><td>50.0</td></tr>
    <tr><th>POSITION</th><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr>
</table>
<h3 id="aaccessing">Accessing Array Elements</h3>
<div class="cont">An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of
    the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example:
<div class="code">double salary = balance[9];</div>
The above statement will take 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary
variable. Following is an example which will use all the above mentioned three concepts
viz. declaration, assignment and accessing arrays:</div>
<div class="code">
<pre>
#include <stdio.h>
int main ()
{
 int n[ 10 ]; /* n is an array of 10 integers */
 int i,j;
 /* initialize elements of array n to 0 */
 for ( i = 0; i < 10; i++ )
 {
    n[ i ] = i + 100; /* set element at location i to i + 100 */
    }
   
    /* output each array element's value */
    for (j = 0; j < 10; j++ )
    {
    printf("Element[%d] = %d\n", j, n[j] );
    }
    return 0;
   }
</pre>
</div>
<div class="cont">
Output:
Element[0] = 100
Element[1] = 101
Element[2] = 102
Element[3] = 103
Element[4] = 104
Element[5] = 105
Element[6] = 106
Element[7] = 107
Element[8] = 108
Element[9] = 109
</div>
<h3 id="marray">Multi-dimensional Arrays</h3>
<div class="cont">
C programming language allows multidimensional arrays. Here is the general form of a
multidimensional array declaration:
<div class="code">type name[size1][size2]...[sizeN];</div>
For example, the following declaration creates a three dimensional 5 . 10 . 4 integer array:
<div class="code">int threedim[5][10][4];</div>
</div>
<h4 id="2darray">Two-Dimensional Arrays</h4>
<div class="cont">
The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array. A twodimensional array is, in essence, a list of one-dimensional arrays. To declare a twodimensional integer array of size x, y you would write something as follows:
<div class="code">type arrayName [ x ][ y ];</div>
Where type can be any valid C data type and arrayName will be a valid C identifier. A twodimensional array can be think as a table which will have x number of rows and y number
of columns.<br>
Every element in array a is identified by an element name of the form a[ i ][ j ], where a is the name of the array, 
and i and j are the subscripts that uniquely identify each element in a n array</div>
<h4 id="2daintialiasing">Initializing Two-Dimensional Arrays</h4>
<div class="cont">
Multidimensional arrays may be initialized by specifying bracketed values for each row.
Following is an array with 3 rows and each row has 4 columns.
<div class="code">
<pre>
int a[3][4] = {
{0, 1, 2, 3} , /* initializers for row indexed by 0 */
{4, 5, 6, 7} , /* initializers for row indexed by 1 */
{8, 9, 10, 11} /* initializers for row indexed by 2 */
};
</pre>
</div>
The nested braces, which indicate the intended row, are optional. The following initialization
is equivalent to previous example:
<div class="code">int a[3][4] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11};</div>
</div>
<h4 id="2daaccessing">Accessing Two-Dimensional Array Elements</h4>
<div class="cont">
An element in 2-dimensional array is accessed by using the subscripts, i.e., row index and
column index of the array. For example:
<div class="code">int val = a[2][3];</div>
The above statement will take 4th element from the 3rd row of the array. You can verify it
in the above diagram. Let us check below program where we have used nested loop to
handle a two dimensional array:
</div>
<div class="code">
<pre>
#include <stdio.h>
int main ()
{
 /* an array with 5 rows and 2 columns*/
 int a[5][2] = { {0,0}, {1,2}, {2,4}, {3,6},{4,8}};
 int i, j;
 /* output each array element's value */
 for ( i = 0; i < 5; i++ )
 {
 for ( j = 0; j < 2; j++ )
 {
 printf("a[%d][%d] = %d\n", i,j, a[i][j] );
 }
 }
 return 0;
}
</pre>
</div>
<div class="cont">
Output:<br>
<pre>
a[0][0]: 0
a[0][1]: 0
a[1][0]: 1
a[1][1]: 2
a[2][0]: 2
a[2][1]: 4
a[3][0]: 3
a[3][1]: 6
a[4][0]: 4
a[4][1]: 8
</pre>
</div>
<h3 id="aasparameter">Passing Arrays as Function Arguments</h3>
<div class="cont">
    <p>If you want to pass a single-dimension array as an argument in a function, you would have
        to declare function formal parameter in one of following three ways and all three
        declaration methods produce similar results because each tells the compiler that an integer
        pointer is going to be received. Similar way you can pass multi-dimensional array as formal
        parameters.</p>
</div>
<div class="code">
<pre>
//1.
void myFunction(int *param)
//2.
void myFunction(int param[10])
//3.
void myFunction(int param[])
</pre>
</div>
<h3 id="areturning">Return array from function</h3>
<div class="cont">
C programming language does not allow to return an entire array as an argument to a
function. However, you can return a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name
without an index. You will study pointer in next chapter so you can skip this chapter until
you understand the concept of Pointers in C.<br>
If you want to return a single-dimension array from a function, you would have to declare a
function returning a pointer as in the following example:
</div>
 <div class="cont">
int * myFunction()
 </div>
</body>
